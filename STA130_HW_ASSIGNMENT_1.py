# QUESTION 4
# 
# 
# 1. Number of Columns Analyzed
# 
# df.shape: This function returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the DataFrame. For the Titanic dataset, it would return (891, 15), indicating 891 rows and 15 columns.
# 
# 
# df.describe(): This function provides summary statistics for numerical columns by default. In the Titanic dataset, it typically analyzes fewer columns because not all columns are numerical. For example, it might only analyze columns like Age, Fare, SibSp, and Parch.
# 
# 
# 2. Values Reported in the “Count” Column
# 
# df.shape: The shape function does not provide counts of non-null values; it simply gives the total number of rows and columns.
# 
# 
# df.describe(): The “count” column in the output of df.describe() shows the number of non-null entries for each numerical column. This can be less than the total number of rows if there are missing values (NaNs) in those columns.

# Question 5:
# 
# 
# The main difference between attributes and methods are that attributes carries data and info and are the features of an object. Methods on the other hand, are functions that serve the purpose of performing an action. Furthermore, attributes doesn't need parentheses, but methods do.

# Note: I was not signed into copilot while completing the prelecture, so I do not have the chat logs and summary to the conversation.

# Post-lecture
# 
# 
# 1. Count: The number of non-null entries for each column.
# 
# 2. Mean: The average value of each column.
# 
# 3. Standard Deviation (std): A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of the values.
# 
# 4. Minimum (min): The smallest value in each column.
# 5. 25th Percentile (25%): The value below which 25% of the data falls (also known as the first quartile).
# 6. 50th Percentile (50%): The median value, which is the middle value of the dataset.
# 7. 75th Percentile (75%): The value below which 75% of the data falls (also known as the third quartile).
# 8. Maximum (max): The largest value in each column.
# 

# Question 7;
# 
# 1. A scenario where using df.dropna() might be preferred over del df['col'] is when your dataset has missing values and you want to delete entire rows instead of entire columns. Furthermore, it would be preferred in certain cases because deleting columns can result in losing information, whereas deleting rows can keep complete data and clean up the data set overall. 

# In[6]:


import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
    'Email': ['alice@example.com', 'bob@example.com', None, 'david@example.com'],
    'Age': [25, None, 30, 22],
    'Purchase Amount': [100, 150, None, 200]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Drop rows with any missing values
df_cleaned = df.dropna()

print(df_cleaned)


# In[7]:


# Delete the 'Email' column
del df['Email']

print(df)


# 2. An scenario would be the opposite of the first, where you want to keep certain information and delete entire columns where the information is deemed not as important or unwanted. Additionally, del df['col'] can keep the valuable information untouched. 

# 3. 
# 
# It is important because it allows for more efficient operations as it removes unnecessary data, as a result, saving memory and reduces uneeded computations/errors.
# 
# Futhermore, it also lets dropna() operate with the desired data, giving a more accurate result. 

# In[9]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
print(df.head())

# Display the columns and the number of rows
print(df.columns)
print(f"Number of rows: {df.shape[0]}")


# In[10]:


del df['deck']

print("Initial DataFrame:")
print(df.info())


# In[12]:


df_clean = df.dropna()

# Display cleaned DataFrame information
print("\nCleaned DataFrame:")
print(df_clean.info())


# 4. 
# First I used del df['deck'] to remove the deck column because it had many missing data, then I used df.dropna() to remove any remaining rows that have missing information. At first, there was 891, and after deleting rows and columns, there is only 712 entries left. 

# Sure! Here’s a summary of our conversation:
# 
# Order of Operations in Pandas: We discussed why it’s important to apply del df['col'] before df.dropna(). Key reasons include memory efficiency, accuracy of dropna(), avoiding unnecessary computation, and maintaining data integrity.
# Titanic Dataset: You provided a URL to the Titanic dataset, and we explored its columns and the amount of data it contains. The dataset has 891 rows and includes columns like survived, pclass, sex, age, sibsp, parch, fare, embarked, and more.
# Removing Missing Data: We looked at how to remove missing data using a combination of del df['col'] and df.dropna(). An example was provided where we deleted the deck column and then used dropna() to remove rows with any missing values.

# Question 8:
# 
# 
# 1. df.groupby('col1')['col2'].describe() lets me see the summary between 2 specific columns I want. 
# 
# 2. The count in df.describe() is the total number of non-null entries in each column. In df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe(), the count is the number of non-null entries in "col2" for each group in "col1". df.describe() gives a broader count than df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe().

Question 9:
    
No


# Sure! Here’s a summary of our conversation so far:
# 
# Titanic Dataset Analysis:
# You mentioned you are working on initial summary analyses of the Titanic dataset and asked for help understanding the code and analysis.
# I provided a basic outline of steps and code snippets for loading the dataset, getting an overview, checking for missing values, and visualizing distributions.
# Groupby and Describe:
# You asked about the code df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe().
# I explained that it groups the DataFrame by col1 and provides descriptive statistics for col2 within each group.
# KeyError Issue:
# You encountered a KeyError because the column "col1" didn’t exist in your DataFrame.
# I suggested checking the column names and ensuring the correct column name is used.
# Difference Between df.describe() and Groupby Describe:
# You asked why df.describe() captures something different from df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe().
# I explained the difference in scope and context between overall descriptive statistics and grouped descriptive statistics.
# NameError Issue:
# You encountered a NameError because the variable titanic_df was not defined.
# I provided the complete code to load the dataset, check column names, and perform the groupby and describe operation.

# You
# Sent by you:
# give and summary and describe each of the summary statistics given by df.describe()
# Copilot
# Sent by Copilot:
# Sure! The df.describe() function in pandas provides a summary of the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a dataset’s distribution, excluding NaN values. Here are the summary statistics it typically includes:
# 
# Count: The number of non-null entries for each column.
# Mean: The average value of each column.
# Standard Deviation (std): A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of the values.
# Minimum (min): The smallest value in each column.
# 25th Percentile (25%): The value below which 25% of the data falls (also known as the first quartile).
# 50th Percentile (50%): The median value, which is the middle value of the dataset.
# 75th Percentile (75%): The value below which 75% of the data falls (also known as the third quartile).
# Maximum (max): The largest value in each column.
# Would you like to dive deeper into any of these statistics?
# 
# You
# Sent by you:
# Provide an example of a "use case" in which using df.dropna() might be peferred over using del df['col']
# Copilot
# Sent by Copilot:
# Certainly! Here’s an example to illustrate when df.dropna() might be preferred over del df['col']:
# 
# Use Case: Cleaning a Dataset with Missing Values
# Imagine you have a dataset of customer information, and you want to perform some analysis. The dataset includes columns like Name, Email, Age, and Purchase Amount. However, some rows have missing values in various columns.
# 
# Scenario:
# You want to remove any rows that have missing values in any column to ensure your analysis is based on complete data.
# 
# Using df.dropna():
# Python
# 
# import pandas as pd
# 
# # Sample DataFrame
# data = {
#     'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
#     'Email': ['alice@example.com', 'bob@example.com', None, 'david@example.com'],
#     'Age': [25, None, 30, 22],
#     'Purchase Amount': [100, 150, None, 200]
# }
# 
# df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# 
# # Drop rows with any missing values
# df_cleaned = df.dropna()
# 
# print(df_cleaned)
# AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
# Output:
#     Name              Email   Age  Purchase Amount
# 0  Alice  alice@example.com  25.0            100.0
# 3  David  david@example.com  22.0            200.0
# 
# In this case, df.dropna() is preferred because it removes any rows that contain missing values in any column, resulting in a DataFrame with only complete data.
# 
# Using del df['col']:
# If you were to use del df['col'], you would only be able to delete entire columns, not rows. For example:
# 
# Python
# 
# # Delete the 'Email' column
# del df['Email']
# 
# print(df)
# AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
# Output:
#       Name   Age  Purchase Amount
# 0    Alice  25.0            100.0
# 1      Bob   NaN            150.0
# 2  Charlie  30.0              NaN
# 3    David  22.0            200.0
# 
# Here, you lose the entire Email column, which might still contain valuable information for other rows. Therefore, df.dropna() is more suitable when you want to clean the dataset by removing rows with missing values rather than deleting entire columns.
# 
# Does this example help clarify the difference?
# 
# You
# Sent by you:
# Provide an example of "the opposite use case" in which using del df['col'] might be preferred over using df.dropna()
# Copilot
# Sent by Copilot:
# Absolutely! Here’s an example where using del df['col'] might be preferred over df.dropna():
# 
# Use Case: Removing an Irrelevant or Unnecessary Column
# Imagine you have a dataset of employee information, and it includes columns like Employee ID, Name, Department, Email, and Notes. The Notes column contains miscellaneous comments that are not relevant to your analysis.
# 
# Scenario:
# You want to remove the Notes column because it is not needed for your analysis, and you want to keep all rows intact.
# 
# Using del df['col']:
# Python
# 
# import pandas as pd
# 
# # Sample DataFrame
# data = {
#     'Employee ID': [1, 2, 3, 4],
#     'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
#     'Department': ['HR', 'IT', 'Finance', 'Marketing'],
#     'Email': ['alice@example.com', 'bob@example.com', 'charlie@example.com', 'david@example.com'],
#     'Notes': ['Good performance', 'Needs improvement', 'Excellent', 'Average']
# }
# 
# df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# 
# # Delete the 'Notes' column
# del df['Notes']
# 
# print(df)
# AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
# Output:
#    Employee ID     Name Department              Email
# 0            1    Alice         HR    alice@example.com
# 1            2      Bob         IT      bob@example.com
# 2            3  Charlie    Finance  charlie@example.com
# 3            4    David  Marketing    david@example.com
# 
# In this case, del df['col'] is preferred because it removes the entire Notes column, which is not needed for your analysis, while keeping all rows and other columns intact.
# 
# Using df.dropna():
# If you were to use df.dropna(), it would remove rows with any missing values, which might not be what you want if you only need to remove an unnecessary column.
# 
# Python
# 
# # Drop rows with any missing values
# df_cleaned = df.dropna()
# 
# print(df_cleaned)
# AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
# Output:
#    Employee ID     Name Department              Email              Notes
# 0            1    Alice         HR    alice@example.com    Good performance
# 1            2      Bob         IT      bob@example.com  Needs improvement
# 2            3  Charlie    Finance  charlie@example.com           Excellent
# 3            4    David  Marketing    david@example.com             Average
# 
# Here, df.dropna() would not be effective in removing the Notes column and would instead focus on rows with missing values, which is not the goal in this scenario.
# 
# Does this example help clarify when del df['col'] might be more appropriate?
